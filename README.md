# INDE-577 by Rice University

This is a repository of all projects created in my graduate level INDE 577 Data Science and Machine Learning course during the Fall 2021 semester at the Rice University. My instructor is Randy Davila. The aim of the course is to acquaint students with techniques of data science and machine learning.  Both programming the models and the underlying mathematics will be explored. The applications are drawn from a wide variety of areas such as: image processing and classification, clustering, natural language processing, text mining, probability-based prediction, engineering applications, health-care modeling, business applications, etc.

This repository contains mainly supervised learning algorithms, and one unsupervised learning algorithms. Supervised learning includes: k-nearest neighbors algorithm, gradient descent, linear regression, logistic regression, perceptron, multilayer perceptrons, decision trees, decision trees, random forest, neural networks, ensemble methods. Unsupervised learning includes k-means clustering. Files in this repository are of jupyter notebooks that are created from the machine learning algorithms that are learned in class and referenced in various textbooks.
