# Perceptron

## Introduction
In machine learning, the perceptron is an algorithm for supervised learning of binary classifiers. A binary classifier is a function which can decide whether or not an input, represented by a vector of numbers, belongs to some specific class. It is a type of linear classifier, i.e. a classification algorithm that makes its predictions based on a linear predictor function combining a set of weights with the feature vector.

## Contents 
In this notebook, we use single layer perceptron to classify data generated using the random seed of the system.

## Dataset
There is no specific dataset in this case. The data generated using the random seed of the system.


## Software Requirements
The following packages will be needed to run the code below: 

* pylab [documentation](https://www.kite.com/python/docs/pylab)
* Matplotlib [documentationra](https://matplotlib.org/)
* Numpy [documentation](https://numpy.org/doc/)
* Sklearn [documentation](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
